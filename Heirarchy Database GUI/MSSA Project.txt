My name is Greg Stephens and my main goal is to enhance my knowledge and versatility in web development to create useful and easy to use programs. 
To that end i have picked out three ideas on my project that would be useful in building my foundation of background elements of a program, strengthening my grasp on
databases and interoperability between information and user.

My first pick is to build an encyclopedia. a user friendly system that delivers information on animals native to the north americas. doing an encyclopedia like this 
will be an excellent exercise in creating many tables and categories that operate together to deliver coherent information to the user. adding features like regional
separation and genus/family/species identifiers to provide an overhead look at the different types of animals in particular

my second idea would be to build a strategy game. ideally i would choose to create a game like chess. building a game with different pieces that perform different function and have
differing limitations would be a great method of building my skills of interoperability between tables and the display. 

my final idea would be to create a database GUI. along the same lines as my strategy game, this would provide an excellent opportunity to hone my skills at providing the information in
the database to the user in a clean and easy to digest manner. I would build a database of the the majcoms of the air force that contain all the wings, groups and squadrons along with their
missions, operability and headcount and make a user interface that provides all of this information quickly and effectively.

These propositions are all great ways to strengthen my foundations, particularly concerning interoperability between database information and user interface.
I believe that any of these idea would be a great method of furthering my skills as a future web developer.
